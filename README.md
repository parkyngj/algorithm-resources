Welcome DBC-whiteboarding-wednesday-ers :) I'm assuming that you've reached this repo through the link provided on the [DevBootcamp Algorithm Night README](https://github.com/DevBootcamp-Algorithm-Night/DevBootcamp-Algorithm-Night.github.io).

If you are here in search of resources (practice problems, sources for practice problems, miscellaneous notes), please see:

* [My personal algorithm practice repo](https://github.com/sally/algos)
* [My accountability group's algorithm practice repo](https://github.com/sally/algoccountabilibuddies)

And please contact me at parkyngj@gmail.com if you need help, or have questions. I'd be more than happy to chat with you!

-Sally
